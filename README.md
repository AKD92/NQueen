Solution to the classic n-queen problem.

This code has several dependencies over existing algorithmic libraries, namely
1. libdictionary - Uses AVL Tree based Dictionary (AvlTree).
2. libstq		 - Uses Stack and Queue data structures.
3. liblinkedlist - Uses linked list (List) data structure.

This project uses the following compilers:
1. TDM-GCC 32-bit Mingw for compiling 32-bit executables.
2. TDM-GCC 64-bit Mingw-w64 for compiling 64-bit executables.

This project is created in Code-Blocks IDE.
